          Dear Meditation members and visitors,
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to the outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) around the world, and the affect on the United Kingdom. The
          Dhammakaya Meditation Centre is truly concerned about the safety and well being of all members and visitors.
        </p>
        <p>
          To prevent and reduce the spread of coronavirus, all classes and retreat programmes will be postponed until
          further notice. However, we would like to encourage our members to keep practicing meditation, therefore we
          may
          open online classes and provide meditation guidance and other material through online channels.
        </p>
        <p>
          We would like to apologise for any inconvenience caused. Once the situation has improved, and upon
          consideration
          of the situation, we will notify everyone and resume all activities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thank you all members, class participants, and visitors for your cooperation.
