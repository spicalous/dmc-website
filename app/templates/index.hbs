        What we do
      </h3>
      <div class="text-justify">
        While many are searching for peace from without, we believe that world peace MUST begin from each and everyone
        of us. Thatâ€™s why we promote the use of meditation in order to help individuals cultivate inner peace inside
        themselves.
