      In the morning, the participants played mindfulness games to break the ice and introduced agreements for living
      peacefully together. Shortly after, the teaching monk commenced the first meditation session. The class meditated,
      guided by the voice of the teaching monk for 20 minutes. Following meditation, the participants took part in light
      exercise to relax their bodies.

      In the evening, the participants learnt how to keep clean and tidy according to the “UG5" (Universal Goodness 5)
      techniques. At the end of the day, before going to bed, the participants were given a Dhamma sermon: “Exercise
      your mind throughout the day”, and also had a meditation session, kindly led by teaching monk for 40 minutes.
      Before each meditation session, the class read quotes from a Dhamma book related to ideas from meditation. This
      activity turned out to be interesting and demonstrated good opinion and understanding from the participants

    The participants woke up early at 5:30am and meditated for 40 minutes. They then did yoga to stretch their bodies.
    In the late morning, the teaching monk gave a Dhamma talk about “Precepts” and led meditation for 60 minutes. In the
    afternoon, the teaching monk gave a Dhamma talk on the topic of “World Peace through inner peace” and led meditation
    for 45-60 minutes. Then after the meditation session, the participants wrote their meditation experiences and found
    that everyone had good inner experience and were happy and peaceful from meditation. When the retreat was over, the
    participants helped one another to clear up seats in the meditation room and bedrooms, before departing safely,
    happily and peacefully.
