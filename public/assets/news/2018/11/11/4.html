    This year the Kathina ceremony took place on the 11th November 2018. The ceremony started at 09:00 and began with
    the installation of the stained glass windows at the back of the chapel. This is part of the renovation work that
    has been on-going to make St Andrews Church a temple for the community to find peace and practice meditation.

    After the celebrating the installation of the stained glass windows. The next ceremony takes place outside of the
    temple. Alms offering involves lay people offering sustenance, such as food, to monks as an act of virtue. This
    simulates the tradition in Thailand, where monks take part in an alms round to accept any food (if any were offered)
    to sustain life.

    The last part of the ceremony takes place in the afternoon. Kathina is a Buddhist festival which comes at the end of
    Vassa, the three-month rainy season retreat for Theravada Buddhists. The season during which a monastery may hold
    Kathina is one month long, beginning after the full moon of the eleventh month in the Lunar calendar (usually
    October). It is a time of giving, for the lay people to express gratitude to Buddhist monks. Lay Buddhists bring
    donations to temples, traditonally new robes for the monks.
